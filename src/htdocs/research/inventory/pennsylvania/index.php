			<p>
				Pennsylvania has a wide variety of landside occurrences, on both geologic and human time scales.
				The Greater Pittsburgh urban area has the best documented and most publicized landslide problems, but other parts of the Commonwealth are also prone to slides.
				Information on costs to remediate landslide effects is incomplete but damages to utilities, buildings and roadways probably averages in the tens of millions of dollars per year.

				Maps for most of western Pennsylvania are included in the USGS Open-File Landslides and Related Features Maps prepared in the 1970's and 1980's.
				These maps have been scanned and are posted as PDF files on our website at
				<a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/hazards/landslides/slidepubs/index.htm" class="offsite" target="_blank">

			<p>
				Pennsylvania Survey staff complete a partial inventory and susceptibility study in north-central Pennsylvania in the 1980s.
				<!--Ordering information is available at:
				<a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/ucmprd1/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_006703.pdf" class="offsite" target="_blank">

				</a>-->
			</p>

			<p>
				No formal inventory activities are presently ongoing, but we collect data on occurrences as we learn of them.
				We are looking at ways to use our recently acquired state-wide Lidar elevation data to improve the existing information on landslides and other surface features in Pennsylvania.
				A long term goal is to develop a digital database which will be available to the public.
