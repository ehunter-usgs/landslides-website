<h3>Introduction to Landslide Activities in North Carolina</h3>

	<p>There is a significant slope movement hazard in North Carolina, mainly in the mountainous western region.  Recent and historical evidence shows that major damaging debris flow events have affected the region at least four times from 1916 to 2004.  The North Carolina Geological Survey (NCGS) has undertaken a major mapping program to develop slope movement hazard maps for 19 western North Carolina counties.  This work was authorized and funded by the N.C. General Assembly in the Hurricane Recovery Act of 2005; however, at present the maps are informational and not regulatory.  In addition to mapping, NCGS staff respond to technical assistance requests from local governments and the N.C. Division of Emergency Management in landslide instances that affect public safety and provide educational outreach to citizens and governmental agencies.</p>

	<p>For each county, the NCGS creates a series of GIS maps that show slope movements and slope movement deposit locations, relative hazard rankings for debris flow initiation areas, and downslope hazard areas for potential debris flow pathways. An aggressive mapping schedule calls for completing 2-3 counties per year.</p>

	        <ul><li>This website provides basic information on landslide hazards, recent examples of landslides that occurred in North Carolina, and links to maps and other data products. Currently, our completed counties, Macon and Watauga are available for download as a series of PDFs. Based on the needs of the recipient counties and citizen requests we are creating a GIS webmap service. It will be updated frequently as new data is created and will be viewable at the parcel level. We anticipate this service to become active in Fall 2008.</li></ul>

<h3>Inventory Status for North Carolina</h3>

	<p>The NCGS actively maintains a landslide inventory (slope movement-slope movement deposit database) with over 5,600 data points.  The database is currently in a MS Access format, but we plan to migrate to a GIS-geodatabase in the near future. Database entry information includes categories for location, landslide and deposit (e.g., debris fans) type, displaced mass dimensions, damage, movement history, slope configuration, geomorphology, lithology, Unified Rock Classification System, bedrock structure, soil classification and thickness, vegetation, surface water, groundwater features and others.</p>

	<p>We have completed landslide hazard maps for two NC counties: Macon and Watauga. Our current work focuses on Buncombe County, with a projected completion time in Fall 2008.</p>
