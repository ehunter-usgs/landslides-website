    The interactive map above displays estimates of the probability of debris flow (in %), potential volume of debris flow (in m<sup>3</sup>), and combined relative debris flow hazard.  These predictions are made at the scale of the drainage basin, and at the scale of the individual stream segment.  Estimates of probability, volume, and combined hazard are based upon a design storm with 10-year recurrence interval (i.e., a 1 in 10 chance of a storm of that magnitude occurring in any given year).  Predictions may be viewed interactively by clicking on the button at the top right corner of the map displayed above.
